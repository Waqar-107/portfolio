    title: "ISSR Graduate Poster Contest (Fall 25) - Second Place in Proposed Research Category",
    details: "ISSR, ASU organizes a poster contest every fall and spring semester. They have two categories - proposed research and completed research. From each category, they select the top 3 and some honorable mentions. We won the second prize ($1000) in the proposed category in Fall 25 among 100+ submissions.\n\nA gallery view of all the posters can be found in this link (https://issr.asu.edu/events/poster-contest).\n\nIn this proposed research, we plan to investigate how people in Arizona, USA, plan their routes before going out, how they use existing technology (e.g., weather apps) to plan, and how we can improve the current navigation system to suggest them cooler routes to reduce the heat exposure."
